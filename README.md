Welcome to Zansha's Overview Github

Whenever a new version of any overview is created, you will find it here first before we get a chance to update it in our in-game channels and mailing lists.

Full details on each overview and what it's for can be found on our wiki: **[Zansha's Overview](https://wiki.zansha.space/index.php/Zansha%27s_Overview)**

This overview is based on Z-S Overview,
which in turn is based on SaraShawa Overview,

This project was begun by Lyra Swift at a time when Zirio was unable to update Z-S Overview due to IRL commitments limiting his access to EVE-Online, and following some patches there were quite a few functions missing.
